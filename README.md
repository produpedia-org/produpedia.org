Current state: Released, 1.0

Produpedia is a free and open data browser, free of ads, promotion, redirects or preferences. It will always be collaborative, transparent, independent and user-centered and is currently rendering data mostly taken from DBpedia. You can find further information about it on the page itself.

Your contributions are welcome! You can check out the issues if you're interested.

On how to build locally, see the READMEs in the subfolders [api](api) and [web](web), and on how to build the database, see [here](https://github.com/produpedia-org/dbpedia-import/) or just download it [here](https://produpedia.org/static/download.html). Generally, the architecture is simple as it only consists out of those three components. The API exposes a public HTTP endpoint for the GET requests.
